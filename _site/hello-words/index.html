    <h2 class="post_title">Hello Words</h2>
    <p>Yes, I&#8217;m starting (another) blog. And there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to start a blog for a while, and various things kept preventing me, but alas here we finally are. I hope that Words will be a little different than my previous <a href='http://theblacktop.com'>foray</a> into personal blogging in a number of ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>I hope to focus mainly on topics concerning the web, programming, CS, or any other issue relating &#8220;technology&#8221; or &#8220;the industry.&#8221; I guess it&#8217;s broad by design.</li>

<li>I hope this won&#8217;t devolve into a personal blog in the style of a LiveJournal; I have Facebook already. Expect the occasional funny picture though.</li>

<li>I hope to update this more often than I did my personal blog in the later years. I may eventually go back to updating that too.</li>

<li>I hope this will be a steady creative outlet. As I stopped writing daily posts for my last <a href='http://bwog.com'>foray</a> into non-personal blogging and started assuming other duties, I started missing the writing, and I hope this will help me scratch the itch.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end though, I just hope for this to be seen as merely my words, and nothing more. They really carry little weight if you think about it.</p>

<p>But I hope you&#8217;ll humor me and join me for the ride.</p>
