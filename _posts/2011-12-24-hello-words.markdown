Yes, I'm starting (another) blog. And there's nothing you can do about it.

I've been meaning to start a blog for a while, and various things kept preventing me, but alas here we finally are. I hope that Words will be a little different than my previous <a href="http://theblacktop.com">foray</a> into personal blogging in a number of ways:

* I hope to focus mainly on topics concerning the web, programming, CS, or any other issue relating "technology" or "the industry." I guess it's broad by design.
* I hope this won't devolve into a personal blog in the style of a LiveJournal; I have Facebook already. Expect the occasional funny picture though.
* I hope to update this more often than I did my personal blog in the later years. I may eventually go back to updating that too.
* I hope this will be a steady creative outlet. As I stopped writing daily posts for my last <a href="http://bwog.com">foray</a> into non-personal blogging and started assuming other duties, I started missing the writing, and I hope this will help me scratch the itch.

In the end though, I just hope for this to be seen as merely my words, and nothing more. They really carry little weight if you think about it. 

But I hope you'll humor me and join me for the ride.
